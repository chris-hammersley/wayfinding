        <div>Prompt 1 - Meryl's Letter to Sharon from Mygdonia River Valley - Jan 2023</div>
        <div class="container">
          <p>
            Dear Sharon and your chosen Water in Winona,<br/>
          <br/>
            I hope this letter finds you well in the New Year. I wasn't sure where to start, and like most things the answer found me when I was mindlessly washing my hands the other day.<br/> 
            <br/>           
            I was reminiscing on something I read.<br/> 
            <br/>          
            "Beliefs are what cause wars."<br/><br/>    
            ..<br/><br/>   
            The first time I went to the water I had a whole lesson planned. Years of study, two over-priced higher educations, decades of physical conditioning, creative pedagogies, somatic certificationsâ€¦ all informing a fantastically full and earnest 40 min lesson - the maximum duration one is permitted to be inside the bath based on hydrothermal health and safety precautions.<br/> 
            <br/>         
            I had the bath to myself, (a hard earned feat), and was eager to try my carefully chosen exercises.<br/> 
            <br/>       
            Almost immediately everything I had previously learned, thought I knew and had prepared to teach became undone.<br/> 
            <br/>        
            None of it worked.<br/> 
            <br/>          
            Truly none of it felt good. Or pleasurable. Or even tolerable in the heat, the humidity, the roaring water that had been consistently echoing as it flowed inside these cavernous stones since 900 AD.<br/> 
            <br/>          
            Oddly, I didn't panic. Maybe because I felt too nauseous, dizzy and out of breath. I didn't analyze my failure, nor try and surgeon my thoughtfully designed curriculum. I didn't try and make the water, and the steam and the rock adhere to my pedagogical beliefs on what is good for bodies.<br/> 
            <br/>          
            I sat down surrendering any pretense of knowing and looked straight into the depths. 
            <br/><br/> 
            A voice from deep within me chuckled.<br/> 
            <br/>       
            "Ok tell me."<br/> 
            <br/>          
            My body heard the water and was responding in motions and movement before my brain even knew what was happening.<br/> 
            <br/>         
            I was turning this way, moving my arm that way, twisting like this, shifting my eyes like that. <br/> 
            <br/>          
            The water told me how to use my voice and the whole space changed...<br/> 
            <br/>        
            Moments before it hurt to take a breath, now I was singing and floating effortlessly. Moments before it hurt to raise my arm over my head and now I could move in 360 degrees up and down, in and out of the depths. Moments before I didn't think I'd last another 10 minutes and now 40 vanished painlessly.<br/> 
            <br/>          
            The water reminded me of one of the deep and humble wisdoms of those who wish to teach, create and make art.<br/> 
            <br/>         
            Listen.<br/> 
            <br/>        
            When I think back on that day I'm grateful to the water for reconciling me to the truth that we don't know anything other than the present moment.<br/> 
            <br/>         
            All we have learned, our educational degrees and experiences, and all we will learn in the future is merely a drop of water washed into the ebb and flow of the now.<br/> 
            <br/>           
            When I started teaching 20 years ago someone gave me a card with the saying, "When the student is ready the teacher will come."<br/> 
            <br/>          
            The implication of course being that when a student is open and ready to learn a teacher will emerge offering some insight.<br/> 
            <br/>         
            For the past 20 years of collaborating, facilitating and leading beings both human and otherwise sharing this planet in creative exploration and experimentation, I've tried to always bear in mind and stay present to the non hierarchal alternative approach as well,<br/> 
            <br/>         
            "When the teacher is ready the student will come."<br/> 
            <br/>          
            .<br/>
            .<br/> 
            <br/>        
            prompt: Go to the water and listen. What does the water say to you?<br/> 
            <br/>          
            .<br/> 
            <br/>        
            This first one is seemingly simple. For sure, I am never above learning it again ðŸ™‚<br/>
            <br/>         
            I look forward to hearing from you on your side.<br/>
            <br/>           
            Sincerely,<br/>
            Meryl and the waters of the Justinian Hammam in Mygdonian Valley, Northern Greece.<br/>
